    <p>The Statistical Transparency of Policing (STOP) program is an Oregon program set up to catch any incidents of profiling by police agencies in the state. This is accomplished by having mandatory reporting of data regarding race, gender, and information about the stop, such as what time and date it was, what type of stop it was, and the outcome of the stop. This data was then aggregated and analyzed for each agency. There were three major tests that were done to check if agencies were engaging in racial profiling. The first is decision to stop analysis, which uses the fact that it is more difficult to tell the race of a person at night than it is during the day to compare stop rates between perceived races when the sun is up compared to during twilight hours. To ensure that it is approximately the same population, these comparisons were made at the same time of day but across months where the sunset time has changed. This type of analysis yielded one agency that had a statistically significant rate of stopping Latinx drivers more in the daylight than at night. The second form of analysis is stop outcomes analysis, which tests to see if people of color tend to have higher rates of certain stop outcomes than white people do. This analysis was controlled for every factor in the dataset other than race, to ensure that there wouldn’t be any confounding variables in the analysis. This resulted in there being many agencies with higher rates of worse outcomes for people of certain races (particularly Latinx) than those that would be predicted. The final form of analysis was search findings analysis, which uses the fact that whether anything was found in a search should level out and be fairly even across all ethnicities, and if there is a significantly lower success rate at finding anything for a given race, then that population might be being over-searched. This analysis did not yield any statistically significant results. After the analysis, as no agency had statistically significant results on any two of those three tests, it was determined that, at this point, there is not any major issue with racial profiling at any agency. However, agencies were told to look at their data more in-depth and see if there’s anything that would make sense to change about their policies.
