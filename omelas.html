      <b>The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas asks whether the happiness of the many is worth the suffering of one.</b> The first half of the story explains in great detail how joyous and happy the town is, before LeGuin takes a sharp turn, showing a child starving, locked in a basement. This child is miserable, but for some reason, whether it be a curse or something else entirely, the only way to keep the rest of the town as it is is to keep them there, as LeGuin writes: “Some of them understand why, and some do not, but they all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city, the tenderness of their friendships, the health of their children, the wisdom of their scholars, the skill of their makers, even the abundance of their harvest and the kindly weathers of their skies, depend wholly on this child's abominable misery.”

      The story highlights the selfishness of both those who stay in Omelas and live with the knowledge that all their happiness is because of the misery of another, and those who leave Omelas but make no move to help the poor child. Nobody tries to help the child, because they know that if they did, then “in that day and hour all the prosperity and beauty and delight of Omelas would wither and be destroyed”, as LeGuin writes. The only choices they have that don’t bring down the “utopian” walls of the society they live in are to stay there and accept the facts of life, or to leave Omelas and go somewhere else, somewhere unknown.

      I think it would be interesting to look at a world where people fight for the child, and try to free them, regardless of the consequences it may have for the future of Omelas. What if the child being trapped doesn’t actually have any effect on the utopian society? 
      <br>
      In Omelas, one person suffers in order to allow everyone else to live in a utopian society. But in the real world, so many people suffer, and hardly anyone can live the joyous life that is shown in the story. But is Omelas a utopia? Is it as close as we could get? Is there a way that we could realistically imagine a city where everyone is happy, without any suffering at all? Or is there always going to be a child suffering in the basement?
