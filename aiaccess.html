            The article talks about neurodivergent people being hired for their skills in precision and pattern identification, so as to help build algorithms that can also have those abilities. This, to me, raises the question of what will happen to these people’s jobs after the algorithm has been built.

            Consider the ethical AI video we watched - I think that, while there are some good things about the AI boom, it is important to also understand how AI can negatively impact people, especially minorities. In situations where AI is used in the hiring process, people that don’t fit the mold (people that are not neurotypical white cis men) get hired less.

            Improving education and career opportunities for neurodivergent people is very important, but recognizing that different people have different experiences and need different technology is vital. The educational technology described here would be extremely beneficial to a subset of neurodivergent people, but to many others it would feel alienating and less useful. It is also of note that when the author of this article uses the term ‘neurodivergent’, they seem to mean ‘autistic or ADHD’. While those are the most talked about forms of neurodiversity, autistic people and people with ADHD are far from the only neurodivergent people. It’s important to use precise terminology, so as not to inadvertently say things about people that you’re not talking about. Everyone’s experiences are different, and while there can be generalizations made about certain groups of people, it is important to understand who you’re talking about, and whether those generalizations have reason to be made.

            I also read Natalie Marchant’s article on the World Economic Forum about accessible education technologies. The AI tools discussed in this article are fairly simple, and seem useful - a tool that can provide personalized math homework, and a tool that uses speech recognition to teach children languages and skills in STEM. These are not the kind of thing people often think of when referring to AI, but they do show some of the ways that AI can be useful in an educational sense.

            This article also discussed other technologies used in education, such as AR and VR technology being used to make lessons more interactive and engaging, and wireless tools that are highly useful in places that don’t have a strong or consistent internet connection for internet-based education technology.
